      <h2>Talk Topic Ideas</h2>
      <p>
	<big>
	  At our first event, Ryan Findley led an awesome group discussion on what members wanted to learn about at future events.
	  The result was this awesome list of possible talk topics. Group members are encouraged to give presentations at
	  Philly Blockchain Tech meetings. If you have expertise in one of these areas, or simply want to research more and present
	  your learnings to the group, consider picking a topic and giving a talk!
